# Palindromic Sums

This is a command line tool that searches a range of numbers to find the one
requiring the most steps to reach a palindromic sum. 

A palindromic sum is found by taking the reverse of a number, adding it to the
original number, and seeing if the result is a palindrome (the same backwards
as it is forwards). If the result is not a palindrome the process is repeated
with the sum, until a palindrome is found.

The number 15, for example, requires only one step, since `15 + 51 = 66`, which
is a palindrome.

The number 19, however, requires two steps, since `19 + 91 = 110`, which is not
a palindrome, but `110 + 11 = 121`, which is.

[Boost][boost] [Multiprecision][multiprecision] is used for large number
support. 

C++11 or later is required for [thread][threads] and 
[lambda expression][lambdas] support.

[Catch2][catch2] is used for unit testing.

# Usage

```
palin [-t n-threads] start end step-limit
```

Where `start` is the first number in the range to be searched, `end` is the
last, and `step-limit` is the maximum number of steps to try before giving
up. 

If `start` and `end` are the same number, `step-limit` will be ignored, and
the program will print out the steps for the number continually until a
palindromic sum is found, or the program is terminated.

The optional argument `-t` can be given, followed by a number indicating how
many threads should be used. If this argument is not given, the program will
attempt to detect how many threads are available and will use all of them.

The arguments `-t 8 100 1000 500`, for example, will produce the following
output:

```
Using 8 threads
100: 1 step
109: 2 steps
156: 3 steps
166: 5 steps
167: 11 steps
177: 15 steps
187: 23 steps
